## Hi!!

This account is in complete shambles right now. I've been too busy working on private projects or live events (sound, video and stage lighting) lately, but there's some neat old stuff knocking around!

About _Me_?? The Obligatory Info™:

- **Sonic Fan!** 🔵🦔
  - Been managing most recent Crush 40 live shows for a few years now.
- **Recent Brony (MLP)!!** 🔵🟣🔴🟡🟠⚪🐴
  - You'll see me at a pony con one of these days, mark my words.
- **C# / .NET Dev For Way Too Long**. 😂📈
  - Used to be somewhat infamous on multiple Discord communities as the go-to ".NET performance/internals guy".
  - [Used to engage a lot in a lot of discussions about .NET's internals](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53593#issuecomment-940939320)
  - [Contributed to .NET..... technically](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/2b55b103e1dfb7c0afcc8042fd154be345fb3744)
- **Love-hate JS**: 📦
  - Expando Objects always make me feel **so, so** good. Until they don't.
- **Love-hate Rust**: 🧇
  - It's really cool, and has its place, but remains next to unusable for anything I ever want to do sadly :([^1]
- **Love-hate C**: 🧇
  - Love for its pure semantic simplicity (and it STILL [finds ways to surprise me](https://jorenar.com/blog/less-known-c#bit-fields)).
  - Despise for header files (we found >x1000 faster, tidier, manageable, portabler ways to do this **decades** ago), and I am forever in awe that as an industry we continue to use them _anyway_. Stop it!!

[^1]: I've written a bunch of things in Rust now. Like most, I _understand_ all of its core rules just fine[^2], and I really like what it's _tried_ to do. But, in the real world, making anything non-linear _under_ the rules is so mind-numbing, so __painfully__ unergonomical (looking at you, generic constraints for callbacks (`Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce` traits)) and all completely collapses the moment you utter the word async (unless you are a `-> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result> + Send + '_>> + Send` sort of person, in which case I legit look up to you), that it's basically not worth the small correctness benefits you'll get outside of systems eng.

[^2]: except unsafe semantics because they get so complicated they practically need a phd in the topic. maybe one day I'll bother to learn them too... maybe one day
