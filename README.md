## Hey!!

This account is in complete public shambles rn, 'cause I've been so busy working on private projects or live events (sound, video and stage lighting), but there's some neat old stuff knocking around!

About _Me_?? The Obligatory Info™:

- **Sonic Fan!** 🔵🦔
  - Been in charge of Crush 40's live shows for years now.
- **Recent Brony (MLP)!!** 🔵🟣🔴🟡🟠⚪🐴
  - You'll see me at a pony con one of these days, mark my words.
- **C# / .NET Dev For Way Too Long**. 😂📈
  - I used to be known on multiple Discord communities as the go-to ".NET performance/internals guy".
- **Love-hate JS**: 📦
  - Expando Objects always make me feel **so, so** good. Until they don't.
- **Love-hate Rust**: 🧇
  - It's really cool, and has its place, but remains next to unusable for anything I ever want to do sadly :([^1]

[^1]: I've written a bunch of things in Rust now. I know its rules, and have always felt I "got" what it's trying to do and _why_ it does things the way it does. But it's __**painfully**__ unergonomical and mentally taxxing (looking at you, generic constraints for callbacks), completely collapses the moment you utter the word async and it's all[^2] just to avoid an incremental GC (not even remotely that expensive for most things) or manual memory management (which other less aggressive languages like Zig already solve).
[^2]: There _are_ non-memory correctness issues it "solves" in the process.... and that's what always excited me about it. But I'm really not sure they're worth all the pain.
